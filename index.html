		<h2>WHAT IS ACCIDENT?</h2>
		<p> An unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury.</p>
<p1>WHY DO ACCIDENTS OCCUR?</p1>
<p2>Most of the fatal accidents occur due to over speeding. ... Faster vehicles are more prone to accident than the slower one and <br> the severity of accident will also be more in case of faster the severity of accident will also be more in case of faster vehicles.<br> Higher the speed, greater the risk.</p2>

<p3> HOW TO PREVENT FROM ACCIDENTS?</p3>

<p4>1.Develop the right attitude about driving. Many teen auto accidents are a result of attitude and maturity, not skills or knowledge. Make a commitment to yourself to practice a responsible attitude about driving. You're controlling over 3,000 pounds of fast-moving metal, and you owe it to yourself, your passengers and other drivers to drive responsibly.<br>
2.Get as much supervised practice driving as possible. Your parents should take an active role in your practice driving. Make a firm schedule with them and stick to it. And keep it up until you take your test to get a license.
Many states now have graduated licensing laws. To learn about the laws in your state visit the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.<br>
3.ALWAYS wear your safety belt. Get into the habit of wearing a safety belt whenever you are in a car, whether as a driver or a passenger - no exceptions.<br>
4.Underage drinking and drug use is illegal. Even if you've consumed only one drink or smoked one joint, there is a chemical effect on your brain that can impair judgment and reaction time. Driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana or other drugs can cost you your license - or your life. Visit Above the Influence for more facts on drug use.</p4>
